# Exit-on-Completion Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The batch application has been successfully updated to exit after job completion instead of running as a persistent service.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. BatchJobRunner.java

- Added `ApplicationContext` dependency for application shutdown
- Added `exitOnCompletion` property from configuration
- Modified `executeJob()` method to return boolean success status
- Added `exitApplicationIfConfigured()` method using `SpringApplication.exit()`
- Application exits with code 0 for success, code 1 for failure

### 2. Application Configuration

- Added `batch.exit-on-completion=true` property
- Controls whether application exits after job completion

### 3. Docker Compose Integration

- Jobs run in containers with environment-based configuration
- Database ports isolated between main app (3306) and jobs (3307)
- Container orchestration handles infrastructure automatically

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Docker Compose Jobs (Verified Working)

```bash
./run-jobs.sh vat-calculation
./run-jobs.sh export-json
```

**Results:**

- ✅ VAT Calculation Job: Completed successfully, exited with code 0
- ✅ JSON Export Job: Completed successfully, exited with code 0
- ✅ Both jobs process data correctly and shut down cleanly
- ✅ Proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- ✅ Clean resource shutdown (database connections, Tomcat, etc.)

### ✅ Exit Behavior Confirmation

**Log Evidence:**

```
2025-09-09 08:25:48 [main] INFO  c.e.batch.config.BatchJobRunner - 🔚 Job execution completed. Exiting application with code: 0
batch-vat-calculation exited with code 0
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Docker Compose Jobs (Recommended)

```bash
# Individual jobs with proper exit behavior
./run-jobs.sh vat-calculation
./run-jobs.sh export-json
./run-jobs.sh all-jobs

# Infrastructure management
./run-jobs.sh start      # Start MySQL and Adminer
./run-jobs.sh stop       # Stop all services
./run-jobs.sh clean      # Clean up everything
```

### Command Line Execution

**Recommended: Use Docker Compose Jobs**
```bash
./run-jobs.sh vat-calculation
./run-jobs.sh export-json
```

**Alternative: Direct JAR execution (requires local MySQL on port 3306)**
```bash
java -jar target/batch-processing-1.0.0.jar --job=vat-calculation
java -jar target/batch-processing-1.0.0.jar --job=export-json
```

### REST API (Service Mode)

```bash
# Still available for monitoring and manual job execution
# Does NOT exit automatically in service mode
docker-compose up
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/batch/jobs/vat-calculation
```

## 🔍 Key Features

1. **Proper Exit Codes**: 0 for success, 1 for failure
2. **Clean Shutdown**: All resources (database, Tomcat) properly closed
3. **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via `batch.exit-on-completion`
4. **Multiple Execution Methods**: Docker Compose, Command Line, REST API
5. **Resource Efficient**: No longer runs as persistent service when not needed

## 🎯 User Request Fulfilled

> "make batch exit when it completed or failed instead of running like a service"

✅ **COMPLETED**: The batch application now properly exits after job completion with appropriate exit codes, making it suitable for container environments and scheduled executions while maintaining all existing functionality.
